    <h2 id="intro" class="chapter-title">Introduction: READ THIS FIRST!</h2>
    
    <p>Congratulations for letting curiosity lead you here. Let's be <b>blunt</b>: This book is <b>not</b> for the faint of faith. The title isn't clickbait, but it <b>is</b> a warning. What follows will <b>upend</b> centuries of dogma, generations of sermons, and the mental frameworks you've inherited if you've set foot in a Christian church. This book will <i>unsettle</i> you. It will challenge ideas you may hold <b>sacred</b>. For those who love their faith, <i>that's terrifying</i>. Beliefs shape identity. To question them feels like <b>losing part of ourselves</b>.</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p class="text-xl font-bold">But truth demands courage.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><b>Part 1 asks a simple question:</b> <i>Would a loving father give snakes and a stone to children begging for bread?</i> <b>Jesus said no.</b> Yet the god of Moses sent <b>venomous snakes</b> and a rock to <i>starving, thirsty</i> Israelites. He also plagued Egypt, <b>killed firstborn sons</b>, and ordered <b>genocide</b>. <b>Repeatedly</b>. Women, children, nursing infants and livestock included. How could this be Jesus' Father? The answer <b>reshapes everything</b>.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Ancient voices like Marcion saw this divide. Scripture shows it plainly:</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Yahweh instituted <b>oaths</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13); Jesus called the inventor of oath-making <b>evil</b> (Matthew 5:37).</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Yahweh met Moses <b>face-to-face</b> (Exodus 33:11); Jesus said <b>no-one</b> had seen his Father (John 6:46).</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Yahweh dwelt in <b>dark, billowing clouds</b> on Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:21); the true God lives in <b>unapproachable light</b> (1 Timothy 6:16).</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Even Abraham was told to <b>murder his son</b> (Genesis 22:2). Ezekiel claims <b>Yahweh commanded human sacrifice</b> to "horrify" the Israelites (Ezekiel 20:25-26). And we <i>never noticed</i> even though it's <b>right there</b> in our bibles in the Law Yahweh gave. <b>Hiding in plain sight!</b> The Abraham story in itself <b>should have horrified us</b>. But our minds and consciences had already been <i>tampered with</i> by then.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">This isn't a minor puzzle. It's a <b>rupture</b> in the story we've been told.</p>

                <p class="journey-description">Evidence that biblical texts were manipulated to maintain the sacrificial system Jesus rejected.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p><b>Part 2 confronts Paul.</b> Jesus warned of <i>"false"</i> prophets, apostles and teachers. Paul <b>checked the boxes</b> on those warnings. Paul's teachings and character <b>clashed</b> with the words of the physical Jesus, whom he'd never met! Paul said it is <i>okay to curse</i> those with differently-held beliefs. Paul said it is <i>okay to be deceptive</i>. Paul almost <b>never</b> quoted the physical Jesus, only the <i>light-being, spirit Jesus</i> he encountered on the Damascus Road. He plainly stated that he had <b>no regard</b> for the physical, flesh-and-bone Jesus. He re-framed Jesus' death as a <b>blood sacrifice</b>, mirroring the Old Testament <b>horror rituals</b> Jesus rejected.</p>        
    <p>Letters attributed to Paul, along with altered and wrongly-interpreted Bible texts, preserved Yahweh's <b>violent laws</b> ... including the sacrifices that <b>repulsed</b> the true God. The result: A story where a <i>loving father murders his son</i> and is worshipped for it. Jesus' message and mission wasn't to be a <b>sacrificial pawn</b> in a game of legal chess between God and Satan. The Father forgives <b>freely</b>, like Jesus. Even when we don't ask him to, <b>WHEN WE "KNOW NOT WHAT WE DO,"</b> like the crucifiers. <b>No blood required.</b></p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="/weapon.jpg" alt="Weapon" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>
    
    <p style="page-break-inside: auto;"><b>Part 3 reveals a hidden truth: The biblical texts were altered.</b> Jeremiah 8:8 says scribes <b>falsified</b> God's words. Paul's writings, together with the altered texts, <i>cleverly</i> shift the focus away from <b>OBEDIENCE TO</b> <b>Jesus' teachings</b> to <b>BELIEF IN</b> concepts <b><i>about</i></b> <b>Jesus</b>. This is a <b>MASSIVE</b> difference. One gets you into the Kingdom of God, the other leaves you <b>outside</b> despite an impressive Christian résumé which may boast signs-and-wonders, miracles, leading mega-churches, even whole-hearted belief and a 'Jesus is my Lord and Savior' confession.</p>
    
    <p>The Law Jesus followed wasn't exactly the Pentateuch we know ... a fact revealed in a 19th-century discovery, almost 80 years before the arrival of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Jesus went out of his way to <i><b>SHATTER</b></i> Yahweh's Law, not fulfill it. He moved to the beat of a <b>different</b> Law, one that will <b>never</b> pass away.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="/scroll.jpg" alt="Scroll" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>This book is for those who struggle to make sense of glaring Bible contradictions; but also, for those whose consciences have been hardened by harsh teachings and harsher attitudes soaked in Pauline psychology. The former know who they are; the latter probably don't, for now.</p>
        <p>It's not about tearing down faith. It's about <b>clearing rubble</b> to find what's real: <b>A FATHER WHO LOVES WITHOUT CONDITIONS.</b> No wrath. No worship of evil in the name of justice.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The outcome? A <b>soft heart</b> free from guilt, radiating <b>fearless love</b>. <b>Non-selective</b> love. A heart that sees Jesus' teachings—and humanity—in a light that <i>heals and empowers</i>. Truth may hurt at first. But it <b>sets you free</b>. It has done so for centuries, for humanity and the planet.</p>
    
    <p>These ideas aren't new, but they've been <i>buried</i> under layers of orthodoxy. Once you see them, <b>you can't unsee them</b>. Your brain will <i>spin inside your skull</i> in an attempt to resist. Your heart will <b>urge you to read on</b>. Your brain is already <i>twisting</i> my words to fit what you already know.... and to get you to set this book on fire.</p>
    
    <p>Awareness of this reflex, of this subconscious battle, might dial down the static ... but <b>don't count on it</b>. If it helps, my three teenagers grasped these concepts in under thirty minutes. We disagree on plenty, but <b>truth cuts through noise</b> when you let it.</p>
    
    <p>The approach I've taken in this book is straightforward: Jesus' words (his authentic words as best we can deduce) reign supreme. They override every other voice—even the "divine" ones stamped with biblical approval. His teachings are the plumbline, the control group in this experiment. But here's the catch:</p>
    
    <p>First, Jesus clashes with the Bible's most <b>revered</b> figures. Moses. Paul. <b>Even the God of the Old Testament</b>. These contradictions aren't quirks—they're <b>seismic fractures</b> in the story you've been told.</p>
    
    <p>Second, Jesus sometimes appears to contradict himself. To untangle this, think like a <i>forensic detective</i>: Is it possible some of his "red-letter" sayings are <b>edits, outright forgeries</b>? I'll try to freeze the frame and dust for fingerprints to get to the evidence.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up in the thick of church life. Sunday wasn't just a day ... it was the center of gravity. My earliest memories are filled with hymns echoing through the church my dad pastored, and the faint smell of <i>worn leather Bibles</i>. Church wasn't something we went to; it was the <i>air we breathed</i>.</p>
    
    <p>Even when I later studied medicine and built a career in business, faith never took a back seat. Every spare moment I had, I spent <i>buried in Scripture</i>, convinced that if I could just study a little harder, pray a little longer, serve a little better, I'd understand God the way He truly wanted to be known.</p>
    
    <p>I was raised Baptist: conservative, careful, certain. Then I found myself drawn into the charismatic world, full of passion and expectancy. I led teams, prayed for the sick, and witnessed what I could only describe as miracles. I saw lives changed, hearts healed, even bodies restored. I'll never forget praying for a deaf teenager and watching her face light up when she began to hear again. For years, I thought that was the pinnacle of faith.</p>
    
    <p>But over time, a <i>quiet unease</i> began to surface ... like a thread tugging loose beneath the surface of my belief system. I started noticing that the things I'd built my faith around <b>didn't always line up</b> with what Jesus actually said. The God I'd been taught to <i>fear</i> didn't sound like the <b>Father Jesus revealed</b>.</p>
    
    <p>It was a slow, <i>disorienting awakening</i>. And yet, that moment of doubt became the beginning of something far more <b>beautiful</b> ... a search for truth that finally felt <b>alive</b>. This book, part of the 5-book series <b><i>"Rediscovering Jesus' Subverted Teachings and the Father's Love,"</i></b> is a glimpse into that journey of awakening.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p style="page-break-inside: auto !important;">As you can imagine with this background, I grew up <b>kneeling at the altar of Biblical Inerrancy</b>. My dad was a respected and influential bible teacher. Every jot and tittle of the scriptures was <b>sacred</b>… the Bible contained <b>no errors</b>. Until I watched <i>supercomputers dissect ancient texts in seconds</i>. Errors aren't theoretical: they're cataloged, quantified, and undeniable. (See Appendix 1 for a cut-down, quick-fire list of 7. And read <b><i>"101 Illustrated Bible Contradictions: And 12 Keys To Unlock The Truths These Reveal,"</i></b> another book in this series, for a deeper discussion on this topic.) Yet this doesn't negate the Creator. If anything, it sharpens the signal beneath the noise.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
        <span class="note-title">A disclaimer:</span>
        <p>I'm not here to convert you, but to show how Jesus revealed the Father as best I can. My own views have shifted and continue to adjust as I dig deeper into Jesus' radical love. This book is a snapshot of my beliefs: a marker for friends and family, and maybe for you. Judge the evidence yourself. Correct me where I'm wrong.</p>
        <p>I've earned no theology degrees (despite years of study which far exceed the hours required for these.) Just <i>scars</i> from decades in medicine, pharma and church life, dissecting human bodies and human beliefs. I wore the <i>"born-again, Spirit-filled, Bible-believing"</i> badge <b>proudly</b> ... until Jesus' <b>unfiltered words</b> turned my blood to <i>ice</i>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><b>Echo chambers</b> amplify what we already know. Churches. Home groups. Social media. Even YouTube's algorithm. We're <i>spoon-fed</i> confirmations, not challenges. But truth? It arrives like a <b>wrecking ball</b>. It <b>shattered my identity</b>. It'll <b>shatter yours too</b>, if you let it. This is <i>painful</i>, but, as the passing of time reveals, is <b>not a bad thing</b>.</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p class="font-bold">Final warning:</p>
        <p>Pray for truth, and you will get it ... <b>raw, unvarnished</b>, and usually <i>nothing like you imagined</i>. Clinging to comfortable lies is easier. But if you crave the <b>thrill of seeing</b>, take the red pill. <b>Turn the page.</b></p>
