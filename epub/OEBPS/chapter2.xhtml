    </h2>
    
    <div class="chapter-opening-quote">
        <p>"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanti-cidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully."</p>
        <span class="quote-author">— Richard Dawkins, <i>The God Delusion</i> (Bantam Books, 2006), p. 51</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Old Testament unveils Yahweh (often rendered as <i>"LORD"</i> in many translations) as more than merely a deity of overwhelming power, a consuming force demanding absolute obedience. <b>It reveals him as the monster he truly is.</b> In Exodus, as the Israelites emerge from Egyptian slavery, they lift their voices in a grim hymn of praise: <i>"Yahweh is a warrior! Yahweh is his name!"</i> (Exodus 15:3, NOG). The words are <b>not metaphorical.</b> Yahweh is no distant watchmaker deity, no passive spiritual guide. He is a <b>God of war.</b> A <b>God of conquest.</b> A God who drowns his enemies, crushes nations beneath his feet, and smites those who resist him. Unlike Jesus' Father, whose power is manifest in <b>love</b>, Yahweh's might is displayed in <b>blood and fire.</b></p>
    
    <p>The Bible is filled with Yahweh's acts of divine wrath … <b>terrifying and total.</b> Those who attempt to justify them, especially in Christian vs. Atheist debates <i>(excruciating and embarrassing to watch)</i> stumble over their own arguments, seeking refuge in convoluted apologetics that dissolve into incoherence. <b>Let me be clear</b>, I completely understand that this is <i>not</i> a matter of intelligence or schooling. There are multiple psychological dynamics at play (the chief one being the <i>'Primacy Effect'</i> or the <i>'Attention Decrement Hypothesis'</i>: <b>the version of the story you hear first holds more value in your mind than the version you hear later.</b> So get in with your story first, if you can, if you want to be believed over someone else.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>This leads to <i>'Inconsistency discounting'</i>: <b>your brain will tend to disregard information that is not consistent with the story you heard first.</b> Once you've been sold on who the good guy is in the movie, then <b>almost nothing they do from that point will change your perception of their hero status.</b></p>

    </div>
    
    <p>This is then complicated by other complex psychological and social dynamics which are beyond the scope of this book, such as <b>'IDENTITY FUSION'</b>, where an individual's <b>personal identity</b> is so deeply intertwined with their <b>social identity</b>, it leads to a <b>profound sense of belonging</b> and commitment to a group. So someone reading this book might find themselves thinking <i>"I know what you're saying is correct, but I can't accept it because it means a <b>large chunk</b> of what I publicly stood for, what my social circle stands for, might be based on <b>error</b>! You are saying all these good people, my good friends, pastors who have spent years in ministry and study, might have been wrong about such a <b>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF</b> ... it feels like you're attacking <b>WHO THEY ARE</b> and thus <b>WHO I AM</b>!"</i></p>

    <p>Consider the following atrocities attributed to Yahweh:</p>
    
    <h3 class="section-title">Yahweh's Atrocities</h3>
    <div class="callout atrocity-box">
        <h4 class="atrocity-title">Global Genocide by Flood</h4>
        <p>Humanity's wickedness incenses Yahweh, who so loved the world, he decided to <b>DROWN THE ENTIRE PLANET</b>. Only Noah and his family survive the apocalypse (Genesis 6–7). The infants, the elderly, the animals? They perish. The justification? Wickedness. The method? Absolute obliteration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout atrocity-box">
        <h4 class="atrocity-title">Massacre of Egypt's Firstborn</h4>
        <p>In a terrifying display of power, Yahweh sends plagues upon Egypt, culminating in <b>THE EXECUTION OF EVERY FIRSTBORN CHILD</b> (Exodus 12:29). The crime of these children? Being born in the wrong house. Their punishment? <b>DEATH</b>. The sight of grieving mothers, their arms empty, is deemed a victory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout atrocity-box">
        <h4 class="atrocity-title">The Slaughter of Amalek</h4>
        <p>Yahweh issues an unequivocal command to King Saul to obliterate one of the Canaanite nations: "Go and strike Amalek… do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey" (1 Samuel 15:3, AMP). This is not war. This is <b>ANNIHILATION</b>!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout atrocity-box">
        <h4 class="atrocity-title">Execution for Gathering Wood</h4>
        <p>In a grotesque perversion of justice, Yahweh commands a Sabbath-breaker to be publicly executed: "The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones" (Numbers 15:35). The crime? Collecting firewood on the wrong day. The sentence? <b>DEATH BY MOB EXECUTION</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="sticks.jpg" alt="Sticks/Gathering Wood" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>

    <p>This brutal tone echoes in other parts of the biblical texts where Yahweh is involved, even the Psalms. Consider Psalm 137, the famous 'By The Rivers Of Babylon' Psalm, a prayer for disaster on an enemy (known as an imprecatory psalm, would you believe) written during the Babylonian exile expressing the exiles' deep anguish and desire for retribution. Verse 9 states:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"Blessed is he who takes your little ones <b>and dashes them against the rock!</b>"</p>
        <span class="quote-author">— Psalm 137:9</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>While this verse reflects the raw emotions of a traumatized people rather than a divine command, its presence in "divinely-inspired" scripture is staggering.</p>
    
    <p>In the above passages, Yahweh is neither a savior nor a redeemer, but an <b>EXECUTIONER</b>, a <b>TYRANT</b> whose justice is meted out through destruction. His commandments are not life-giving but soul-crushing, an iron yoke of demands enforced by swift and brutal punishment.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>Beyond violence, Yahweh demands <b>constant bloodshed.</b> The book of Leviticus reads like a butcher's manual, detailing the endless slaughter of innocent, unsuspecting animals:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"The priest shall burn all of it [a young bull] on the altar, as a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to Yahweh" (Leviticus 1:9, NOG).</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Sacrifice is the price of sin. The rivers of blood flowing from the temple are not symbols of purification ... they are evidence of a system designed <b>TO PERPETUATE GUILT</b> and <b>KILLING</b>, human and animal. There had to be lots of sacrifice. It was the primary economic source of <b>WEALTH</b> ... the stock-exchange of the day. The more sacrifice, the more wealth was generated. So there had to be more sins, which meant more laws. So the laws piled up, to over 613 ...  even for the most trivial of scenarios. More laws, more sins, more guilt, more sacrifices. So the blood and money flowed.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="blood_and_money.jpg" alt="Blood and money" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>
    
    <p>But Yahweh's appetite for blood extended beyond animals and random human law-breakers. His command is chillingly explicit:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"<b>The firstborn of your sons</b> you shall give to Me" (Exodus 22:29, KJV).</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Yes, you read that right. <b>HUMAN SACRIFICE!</b></p>
    
    <p>I want you to let that sink in. Yahweh commanded <b>HUMAN SACRIFICE</b>.</p>
    
    <p>Even though I grew up in church, I didn't see this because I assumed texts like Exodus 13:13, allow for redemption (the buying back) of your child by an animal substitute. <b>If you could afford it, your child did not have to be sacrificed to Yahweh!</b>:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"It will cost you a sheep or a goat to buy any firstborn donkey back from the Lord. If you don't buy it back, then you must break the donkey's neck. <b>You must also buy every firstborn son back from the Lord.</b>" (Exodus 13:13, NOG)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>If you <b>CAN'T</b> afford it? What then? It would seem you have no choice but to <b>go ahead with the sacrifice,</b> just like with the firstborn donkey in the verse above.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="baby.jpg" alt="Baby" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>
    
    <p>Worse still, Ezekiel makes it clear you didn't misread the Exodus 22:29 verse about giving Yahweh your firstborn son. Yahweh himself takes credit for coming up with what he describes as 'horror':</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"I <b>DEFILED THEM</b> [the Israelites] through their gifts ... <b>THE SACRIFICE OF EVERY FIRSTBORN</b> ... that I might <b>fill them with horror </b>so they would know that I am Yahweh." (Ezekiel 20:25-26, NIV)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This is not divine love. Notice how <b><i>the Law itself</i></b> defiled the Israelites. This is psychological warfare. Another version words it this way:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"Moreover, I gave them statutes <b>that were not good</b> and rules by which they could not have life, and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn, <b>that I might devastate them.</b> I did it that <b>they might know that I am Yahweh.</b>" (Ezekiel 20:25-26, English Standard Version)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="note">
        <span class="note-title">Key Point:</span>
        <p>Yahweh calls his Law anything but perfect. He calls it 'not good' – yes <b>'bad.'</b> He openly admits his Law is not life-giving. It defiles. The intention with the human sacrifice command is clear: to <b>horrify,</b> to <b>devastate.</b> Other translations use the word <b>'terrify.'</b></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Your brain might be tripping right now if you recall the following verses from Psalm 19 which appear to state the exact opposite:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"The teachings [Laws] of Yahweh are <b>PERFECT</b>.</p>
        <p>They renew the soul.</p>
        <p>The testimony of Yahweh is <b>DEPENDABLE</b>.</p>
        <p>It makes gullible people wise.</p>
        <p>The instructions of Yahweh are <b>CORRECT</b>.</p>
        <p>They make the heart <b>REJOICE</b>."</p>
        <span class="reference">(Psalm 19:7-8, NOG)</span>
    </div>
    <p>Did we read that right ..... ? Look at what the rest of it goes on to state:</p>
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"The command of Yahweh is <b>RADIANT</b>.</p>
        <p>It makes the eyes shine.</p>
        <p>The fear of Yahweh is pure.</p>
        <p>It endures forever.</p>
        <p>The decisions of Yahweh are true.</p>
        <p>They are <b>COMPLETELY FAIR</b>.</p>
        <p>They are more <b>DESIRABLE</b> than gold, even the finest gold.</p>
        <p>They are <b>SWEETER</b> than honey, even the drippings from a honeycomb"</p>
        <span class="reference">(Psalm 19:8-10, NOG)</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>But Yahweh himself says his Laws are 'not good.' Yahweh says his Law <b>'defiles, fills with horror, devastates.'</b></p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="stone_tablets.jpg" alt="Stone tablets" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>
    
    <p>These texts are incompatible. So, who is telling the truth?</p>
    
    <p>In fairness, I should point out the Israelite religion did not emerge in a vacuum. Yahweh was not unique in his bloodlust and legalism. The ancient Near East teemed with deities (the Elohim) who demanded sacrifice, issued harsh decrees, and ruled by fear. Babylon had Marduk. The Canaanites had Baal. The Code of Hammurabi, older than Moses, also enshrined lex talionis, the infamous "eye for an eye" justice (Exodus 21:24). Yahweh was simply one among many ancient war-gods, vying for dominance in a world where brutality was the language of power.</p>
    
    <p>Yet even among the most merciless 'gods' humanity has ever worshipped, Yahweh stands uniquely monstrous, a ruthless tyrant whose cruelty knows neither boundary nor reason. Other ancient gods, brutal though they might have been, at least extended some faint glimmer of mercy, some slender avenue to escape their wrath.</p>
    
    <p class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-6">Not Yahweh.</p>

    <p>If you grew up in church, what I'm going to say next may be <i>hard to swallow</i>. Yahweh accused the nations of <b>CHILD SACRIFICE</b>, which many say epitomized how evil these nations were. Indeed, the biblical texts themselves confirm this: child sacrifice was considered so <b>abominable</b> that it was explicitly cited as a primary reason Yahweh commanded the Israelites to dispossess and defeat those nations.</p>
    
    <p>Deuteronomy 12:29-31 (NIV) makes the connection explicit:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"The Lord your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land, and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, 'How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.' You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do <b>all kinds of detestable things the Lord hates</b>. They even <b>burn their sons and daughters in the fire</b> as sacrifices to their gods."</i></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Similarly, Deuteronomy 18:10-12 (NIV) lists child sacrifice among the practices that led to Yahweh driving out those nations:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"Let no one be found among you who ... <b>sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire</b> ... Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; <b>because of these same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.</b>"</i></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The message is clear: child sacrifice was so repugnant that it defiled the land itself, making those nations worthy of complete destruction. This practice epitomized their evil … so much so that it justified genocide. Yet Yahweh then calmly proceeds to ask Abraham <b>TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING</b> in Genesis 22:2:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"Take your son, your <b>only son</b>, whom you <b>love</b>—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. <b>Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering</b> on a mountain I will show you."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>You might be thinking <i>"But wait, Yahweh stopped him at the last minute!"</i> ... <b>as if that makes it okay?!</b></p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="abraham_sacrificing.jpg" alt="Abraham sacrificing Isaac" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
    </div>

    <p>In Yahweh's eyes, Abraham <i>proved he was willing</i>. Yahweh counted this as <b>passing the test!</b> An act of <i>faith</i>, would you believe, according to the pro-sacrific writer of the book of Hebrews.</p>

    <p>But here's the thing... <b>Yahweh didn't stop Jephthah at the last minute</b> in the book of Judges! Yahweh <b>let him sacrifice his daughter</b> as payment for a war victory! (Judges 11:39)</p>

    <p>It should be fairly obvious that a father who demands child sacrifice, or even thinks it's remotely OK to dabble with it as a 'test' would be considered a <b>psychopath!</b> That's why Jesus in John 8:44 when speaking to religious hypocrites <b>called him out</b>:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"You belong to your father, the <b>devil</b> ... he was a <b>murderer from the beginning</b>."</i> (NIV)</p>
    </div>

    <p>His justice was <b>absolute and merciless</b>, utterly devoid of compassion or restraint. His punishments did not merely shatter the guilty; they <i>poisoned entire bloodlines</i>, sentencing innocent children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren to suffer endlessly for the crimes of their forebears.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Hear Yahweh's own chilling decree:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, <b>punishing children for the sin of parents to the third and fourth generation.</b>" (Exodus 20:5, NOG)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>What twisted form of justice is this? What perverse morality could justify punishing an innocent child ... much less their children's children ... for the sins committed long before their birth? What kind of monstrous father would curse his own descendants to generations of agony for actions beyond their control?</p>
    
    <p>Thankfully, even within the oppressive shadow of Yahweh's tyrannical rule, voices of defiance arose: brave prophets who dared speak the truth on behalf of the true Father, who dared challenge the terrifying dogma of a cruel and vengeful deity.</p>
    
    <p><b>Ezekiel</b>, boldly speaking for the true God, shatters Yahweh's barbaric doctrine:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"The one who sins is the one who will die. <b>The child will not share the guilt of the parent,</b> nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them." (Ezekiel 18:20, NIV)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Ezekiel's words ring clear: the true God rejects, outright, the vile notion that innocence can bear guilt by bloodline. How absurd ... how utterly <b>OBSCENE</b> ... the idea that you might be held eternally accountable for Adam and Eve's ancient transgressions! Ezekiel crushes this malevolent, evil doctrine of <b>'ORIGINAL SIN,'</b> exposing it as nothing less than <b>THEOLOGICAL TERRORISM</b> designed to enslave humanity under a perpetual cloud of guilt and fear.</p>
    
    <p>And what of the gruesome, blood-soaked rituals, the brutal, endless sacrifices that Yahweh supposedly demanded?</p>
    
    <p>Hosea speaks boldly, exposing the falsehood behind these monstrous rites:</p>
    
    <div class="callout">
        <p>"For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6, NOG)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Jeremiah, relentless in his clarity, demolishes the very foundations of sacrificial worship:</p>

        <p>"For <b>in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices." </b>(Jeremiah 7:22, ESV)</p>

        <p>Let Jeremiah's statement sink deeply into your heart. He is saying plainly, shockingly, that <b>the horrific ritual of slaughtering the 'Passover lamb' ... of painting door-frames with blood to spare lives ... was NEVER commanded by the true God!</b></p>
        <p>According to Jeremiah: God is saying quite clearly "If anyone told you to kill lambs and sprinkle the blood on doorposts, <b>IT WAS NOT ME!</b> Neither did I give those detailed, lengthy instructions on how to kill animals to worship me ....  <b>Those instructions certainly DID NOT COME FROM ME!</b>"</p>

    <p>This revelation detonates every elaborate chapter, and there are many, of Torah instruction on sacrifice, exposing it as <b>AN APPALLING FRAUD.</b> The implications are earth-shattering: Yahweh's grotesque demands <b>were NEVER divine - never originated from the true God</b> - but were manipulations by men wielding religion as a weapon … "the lying pen of the scribes," as another of the true God's prophets, Jeremiah, called out in the eighth verse of the eighth chapter of his book.</p>
    
    <p>These prophets, voices crying out from history's darkest night, demand that we see the truth clearly: something has gone horribly wrong. <b>The true God, the one of mercy, justice, and compassion, has been substituted by a fraud, or horribly misrepresented, hidden beneath layers of violent myth, twisted scripture, and cruel dogma.</b> It is time to confront this ancient deception. It is time to reclaim the God of mercy from the monstrous shadow cast by Yahweh's legacy of brutality.</p>
    
    <p>For the Jewish people of Jesus' time, Yahweh was the one true God, the God of Moses.</p>
    
    <p>But then Jesus arrived ... and his words shattered everything. He did not call his God Yahweh. He called Him Father. And this Father bore no resemblance, none whatsoever, to the wrathful deity of old. Jesus' Father was merciful. Loving. Compassionate. The contrast was blinding.</p>
    
    <p>Jesus did not enforce Yahweh's laws. <b>He broke them.</b></p>
    
    <p>He did not consult the calendar before proceeding with kind acts for his fellow humans. Gathering sticks on the wrong day would get you killed. Jesus did the healings anyway. He touched the unclean. He forgave adulterers.</p>
    
    <p>Sin is defined by one of the New Testament writers as "the transgression of the Law" or 'breaking God's Law (1 John 3:4).' Jesus clearly broke the Law. Not once. Repeatedly (see various instances of this in Appendix 3). What's more, he encouraged others to do the same.</p>
    
    <p><b><i>So, does this mean Jesus sinned?</i></b></p>
    
    <p><b>YES </b>… if the laws he clearly transgressed were God's Laws.</p>
    
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the laws he 'transgressed' were <b>NOT </b>the Laws of his true Father. These were Yahweh's Laws. The Monster, Yahweh.</p>
    <p>Jesus declared that <b><i>"No one has seen the Father"</i></b> (John 6:46), directly contradicting the long-held belief that Moses' encounters with Yahweh were encounters with his Father. This was not a minor adjustment. This was a revolution. What Jesus revealed was earth-shattering. Brace yourself.</p>
