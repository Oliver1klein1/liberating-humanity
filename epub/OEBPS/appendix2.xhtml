        Limited List of 20 Instances of Jesus Breaking the Mosaic Law
    </h2>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>1. Healing on the Sabbath</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 12:10–14, Mark 3:1–6, Luke 13:10–17</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus healed people on the Sabbath, which was traditionally a day of rest when work was forbidden (Exodus 20:8–10). While healing could be considered "work," Jesus justified it by prioritizing mercy and necessity over strict Sabbath rules.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>2. Allowing His Disciples to Pluck Grain on the Sabbath</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 12:1–8, Mark 2:23–28, Luke 6:1–5</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus' disciples plucked and ate grain on the Sabbath, which was considered unlawful work (Exodus 34:21). Jesus defended them by appealing to David eating the consecrated bread and claiming authority over the Sabbath.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>3. Touching the Unclean (Leper and Dead People)</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 8:1–3, Luke 7:11–15</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> According to the Mosaic Law, touching a leper (Leviticus 13:45–46) or a dead body (Numbers 19:11–13) rendered a person unclean. Jesus touched both and healed them, demonstrating his authority over ritual impurity.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>4. Forgiving Sins</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 2:5–12, Luke 7:47–50</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Mosaic Law required offerings at the temple for the forgiveness of sins (Leviticus 4:27–35). Jesus forgave sins directly, bypassing the sacrificial system, which some viewed as blasphemy.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>5. Not Condemning the Woman Caught in Adultery</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> John 8:3–11</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Law of Moses demanded that adulterers be stoned (Leviticus 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:22). When confronted with a woman caught in adultery, Jesus did not enforce this penalty but instead forgave her, challenging the accusers' hypocrisy.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>6. Failure to Perform Ritual Handwashing</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 7:1–5, Matthew 15:1–3</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus and his disciples did not follow the tradition of washing hands before eating, which Pharisees saw as a violation of purity laws. Jesus emphasized inner purity over external rituals.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>7. Declaring All Foods Clean</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 7:18–19</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus dismissed dietary laws (Leviticus 11), declaring that it is not what enters a person that defiles them but what comes out of their heart. This was a radical departure from Mosaic dietary restrictions.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>8. Allowing Women to Interact with Him Publicly</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> John 4:7–27, Luke 7:37–39</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus openly interacted with women, including a Samaritan woman and a known sinner. These actions went against societal norms and the stricter interpretations of the Mosaic Law regarding gender roles and ritual purity.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>9. Overturning Temple Practices</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 21:12–13, John 2:13–16</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> By driving out the money changers and sellers of sacrificial animals from the temple, Jesus disrupted practices allowed under the Mosaic system, challenging the temple's economic and religious framework.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>10. Allowing a Bleeding Woman to Touch Him</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 5:25–34</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> A woman with chronic bleeding (rendering her perpetually unclean under Leviticus 15:19–25) touched Jesus' garment, and he did not rebuke her. Instead, he praised her faith and healed her.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>11. Overlooking the Law of Divorce</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 19:3–9, Mark 10:2–12</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Mosaic Law permitted divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1–4), but Jesus restricted it, allowing it only in cases of sexual immorality. This went beyond the law and challenged established norms.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>12. Failure to Stone Blasphemers</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 9:2–3, John 10:33</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Claiming to forgive sins or equating oneself with God was considered blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16), punishable by death. Jesus made such claims but was not stoned because he challenged the religious leaders' understanding of the law.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>13. Entering Gentile or Unclean Areas</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 7:24–30, Matthew 8:28–34</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus ministered in Gentile regions (e.g., Tyre, Sidon, and Decapolis) and interacted with non-Jews, which could violate purity laws that discouraged association with Gentiles.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>14. Reinterpreting Eye-for-Eye Justice</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 5:38–39</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Law of Moses prescribes "eye for eye" justice (Exodus 21:24). Jesus countered this by teaching non-resistance to evil and turning the other cheek, replacing retribution with forgiveness.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>15. Challenging the Pharisees' Authority</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 23:23–24</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus criticized the Pharisees for strict adherence to minor laws (e.g., tithing herbs) while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness. This defiance undermined their interpretation of the law.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>16. Working During the Feast of Unleavened Bread</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 26:17–19, John 13:1–2</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus and his disciples prepared for the Passover meal during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which had strict rules about labor (Exodus 12:15–16). This could be seen as bending the law for practical reasons.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>17. Ignoring the Purity Laws About Hair</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Luke 7:38, John 12:3</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> A woman anointed Jesus' feet and wiped them with her hair, a practice that would be seen as improper under Mosaic purity laws, especially since the woman was described as sinful.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>18. Challenging the Sacrificial System</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 9:13, Hosea 6:6</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Jesus quoted Hosea, saying, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," which de-emphasized the centrality of the Mosaic sacrificial system in favor of compassion and moral righteousness.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>19. Refusing to Condemn Non-Adherence to Fasting</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Mark 2:18–20</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> When questioned about why his disciples did not fast as required by tradition, Jesus defended them, signaling a shift from legalistic observance to a focus on their relationship with him.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <b>20. Disregarding the Law of Retribution for Theft</b>
    </div>
    <p><b>References:</b> Matthew 5:40–42</p>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Mosaic Law prescribes restitution for theft (Exodus 22:1–4). Jesus taught generosity instead of demanding justice, instructing people to give freely even to those who take from them.</p>
