    <div class="chapter-opening-quote">
        <p class="quote-text"><i>"And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an <b>angel of light</b>."</i></p>
        <p class="quote-attribution">—2 Corinthians 11:14, words of Paul himself, <i>ironically</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>We now shift gears and move to a dusty, deserted Damascus Road, Paul's shining moment. The story has been preached from pulpits, turned into art, immortalized in stained glass. Saul, the persecutor, meets the risen Christ! The enemy of the faith is struck blind, reborn as an apostle of grace!</p>

    <p>But there's <b>something wrong</b> with the story.</p>

    <p>The Jesus who appeared to Paul? He <b>doesn't act like Jesus</b>. He doesn't sound like Jesus. He doesn't speak the way the Galilean rabbi did when he walked among the poor, healing the sick and calling God his Father. No. This Jesus arrives in blinding light. He doesn't invite, or ask for a show of hands, respecting free-will. He <i>overpowers</i>. He doesn't heal. He <i>strikes blind</i>. And when Paul emerges from his darkness, he doesn't preach the same gospel Jesus preached. He brings something new. Something <b>dangerous</b>. A blood sacrifice gospel—where Jesus isn't a teacher of mercy but a payment for sin. A final slaughter to satisfy a vengeful god.</p>

    <p>And the worst part? <b>Jesus warned us this would happen.</b></p>

    <p>Picture the scene. Heat waves rising from the dirt on a desert road. Saul, leading a small group of men, breathing hard with purpose, on a mission. Hunt down Jesus' followers. Drag them back to Jerusalem. <i>Silence them</i>.</p>

    <p>And then—an <b>explosion of light</b>. Not a glow. Not a soft invitation. A violent flash, knocking Saul to the ground. His hands claw at his face. His sight is gone. A voice thunders:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><b>"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"</b> (Acts 9:4)</p>
    </div>

    <p>He gasps. He stammers. <i>"Who are you, Master?"</i></p>

    <p>The answer comes like a knife:</p>

    <p><i>"I am Yeshua, whom you are persecuting."</i></p>

    <p>But something's wrong. This Jesus <b>doesn't touch Saul</b> to restore him. He doesn't tell him, "Do not be afraid." He leaves him <i>blind. Alone. Stumbling in the dark</i> for three days. Does that sound like Jesus?</p>

    <p>This is supposedly the same Jesus who <b>stopped for blind beggars</b>, who knelt in the dirt to heal, who touched the untouchable. He <i>restored</i> sight. He brought peace.</p>

    <p>But the Jesus on the Damascus Road? He <i>cripples</i>. He <i>dominates</i>. He speaks in riddles and disappears.</p>

    <p>And here's the kicker: <b>No one else sees him</b>. The men with Saul? They hear something but can't make out the words (Acts 22:9). In another telling of the story by Paul, he claims they saw the light but heard nothing at all (Acts 9:7). <b>The story contradicts itself.</b></p>

    <div class="note">
        <span class="note-title">Critical Question:</span>
        <p><b>Was this an authentic revelation, or something else?</b></p>
    </div>

    <p>This isn't the first time a bright light ambushed someone in the desert. <i>Think back.</i></p>

    <p><b>Moses</b>. The burning bush. A fire that blazed but did not consume. A voice calling his name— <i>"Moses, Moses!"</i>—just as it did to Saul.</p>

    <p>And then? <i>Laws. Threats. Plagues. Death.</i></p>

    <p>A god who <b>demanded sacrifice</b>.</p>

    <p>A god who <b>demanded blood</b>.</p>

    <p>Paul's blinding light looks <b>eerily similar</b> to Moses' encounter with Yahweh. The same overwhelming presence. The same fear and trembling. In both encounters, the unknown being leaves a physical ailment on the candidate being 'groomed' as proof of his identity – <i>leprosy on Moses' arm, blindness on Paul</i>. This telling clue should have alerted us to his identity.</p>

    <p>Jesus <b>never appeared this way</b> to his disciples. He called them in human ways—through meals, conversations, relationships.</p>

    <p>Saul was <i>ambushed</i>. And the Jesus he met? He was <b>different</b>.</p>

    <p>Paul <b>never met Jesus</b>. Not the real Jesus. Not the one who walked in flesh and blood, who preached in fields and marketplaces, who broke bread with sinners and tax collectors. Everything Paul knew about Jesus came from this blinding encounter and subsequent similar but more <i>secret encounters</i>.</p>

    <p><i>A voice. A light. A command.</i></p>

    <p>Compare that to Peter, John, and James. They <b>walked with Jesus</b>. Ate with him. Heard his voice for years. They watched him die. They saw him rise. They touched his scars.</p>

    <p>Paul? Paul only saw a light. And from that light, he built a theology <b>unlike anything Jesus actually taught</b>.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus demanded faith and a confession. This, defenders of Paul's gospel insist, has to be 'genuine' faith and a 'genuine' confession. The real Jesus demanded <b>love in action</b>.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus was a <i>sacrifice to pay for sin</i>.</p>

    <p>The real Jesus <b>forgave freely</b>.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus spoke only in <i>secret revelations</i>. The real Jesus spoke <b>in the open</b>, to crowds or earnestly to his disciples.</p>

    <p>Do you see the fracture line?</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus <b>isn't Jesus</b>. It's something else wearing his name.</p>

    <p>Here's the part that should send chills down your spine. The real Jesus <b>knew this would happen</b>. He warned us explicitly.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"If anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!'—<b>do not believe it</b>. For false Messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive."</i> (Matthew 24:23-24)</p>
    </div>

    <p>And then?</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"If anyone tells you, 'He is in the <b>wilderness</b>,' do not go out; or, 'He is in the <b>inner rooms</b>,' do not believe it."</i> (Matthew 24:26)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Where did Paul meet his Jesus?</p>

    <p>On the <b>wilderness road</b> to Damascus. The bible itself refers to Damascus as being in the wilderness. Elijah is told to return to <i>"...the wilderness of Damascus"</i> to anoint a certain king in 1 Kings 19:15.</p>

    <p>Where did Paul claim to receive later revelations?</p>

    <p>In <i>secret visions</i>. <i>Inner rooms</i>. <i>Barracks</i>. In Acts 23 the story is told as follows:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"... [The commander] ordered the troops to go down and take [Paul] away from them by force and bring him into the barracks. The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the story Paul conveyed to Luke, the writer of Acts. Here we have Jesus <b>not returning</b> in the way the angels at his ascension said he would. Instead, it is to a murderer in the wilderness and later to the same transformed murderer in an inner room, according to Paul. <b>Just as Jesus warned the non-genuine would do</b>. Jesus tried to warn us about Paul. We just didn't listen.</p>

    <p>But then it gets worse. Paul didn't just get blinded by the light. He walked away with a <b>new gospel</b>. A gospel Jesus never preached. A <i>blood sacrifice gospel</i>. Paul taught that Jesus' death wasn't just a murder. It was a <b>necessary transaction</b>.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"God presented Christ as a <b>sacrifice of atonement</b>, through the shedding of his blood"</i> (Romans 3:25).</p>
        <p><i>"Christ, our <b>Passover lamb</b>, has been sacrificed."</i> (1 Corinthians 5:7).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Paul's Jesus <i>had to die</i>.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus was a <i>payment</i>.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus was a <b>final blood sacrifice</b>.</p>

    <p>But hold on.</p>

    <p>Do you see what a <b>shrewd move</b> this was on the part of Yahweh? If you're going to contaminate a movement, get in early. Before the foundations have been laid, as it were. <b>Paul's letters were written long before Matthew, Mark, Luke and John</b>. They were written <i>decades earlier</i>.</p>

    <p>Did Jesus ever say that he was a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of his blood? Did he ever say there was no forgiveness if blood was not spilled?</p>

    <p><b>No, he did not.</b> And he had numerous opportunities to make it clear. In all the recorded teachings of Jesus, both in the canonical gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) and in the other gospels that didn't make it into the scriptures, Jesus did not spell this out. However, verses were <i>inserted or twisted</i> to make Jesus appear to be making theological claims.</p>

    <p><i>"Wait a minute,"</i> I hear you protest. <i>"Are you saying Jesus did not make this statement: 'The Son of Man came... to give his life as a ransom for many.' Here it is in Matthew 20:28 and Mark 10:45."</i></p>

    <p>I personally believe these sentences were not uttered by Jesus at all. However, if we analyze the manuscripts as though they were indeed quoted by Jesus, a few problems emerge, suggesting some tweaks were certainly made to the text.</p>

    <p>The word "ransom" (Greek: <i>lutron</i>) does <b>not</b> inherently mean a substitutionary sacrifice. In Jewish thought, it often referred to <i>deliverance or liberation</i>, not necessarily a blood price to appease an angry deity. Notice, too, that Jesus says this within the context of <b>servanthood</b>, not sacrifice.</p>

    <p><i>'What about those verses where Jesus seems to be instituting Communion (or the Eucharist to some), like Luke 22:19-20 or Matthew 26:26-28?'</i> You ask.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"Take, eat; this is my body... Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>Surely, this one seals the deal, right? Jesus is literally saying it!</p>

    <p>But let's pause.</p>

    <p>Believe it or not, the biblical manuscripts tell us the texts were <b>altered</b>. Are you even surprised at this point. Even a casual study of the texts makes this obvious. Let's take the first of those two passages, the one in Luke, to illustrate this, starting from verse 17. Most scholars agree the manuscripts have <b>two versions</b> of the text, a long version and a short version. Here's the long version:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"And he took a cup and gave thanks, and he said: "Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I say to you that from now on I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes." And taking bread he gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them saying, "This is my body [<b>that is given for you; do this in remembrance of me." Likewise after supper (he took) the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood that is shed for you.</b>] But see, the hand of the one who turns me over is with me at the table…."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>That is the form of the text found in most manuscripts. But in one old Greek manuscript and some Latin manuscripts, the bolded words in square brackets are <b>missing</b>, leading to the following text.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"And he took a cup and gave thanks, and he said: "Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I say to you that from now on I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes." And taking bread he gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them saying, "This is my body. But see, the hand of the one who turns me over is with me at the table…."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>I agree with Bart Ehrmann that the shorter passage would <b>NOT</b> be one that scribes would likely create but <b>IS</b> one that Luke would have likely written; conversely, the longer passage would <b>LIKELY</b> have been created by scribes but would have been <b>UNLIKELY</b> to have been written by Luke. I believe the shorter form of the text is what Luke wrote, and the longer form of the text is what scribes created. The same argument applies to Matthew 26. I shall not go into detail on this, for the sake of keeping the book reasonable in length.</p>

    <p><i>'How about John 6:53-56?'</i> you may ask:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you... For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>Many have taken this as evidence of a literal sacrificial atonement. However, let's recall that Jesus <b>frequently spoke in metaphors</b>: <i>"I am the bread of life," "I am the vine," "I am the door."</i> These statements were <b>never meant to be taken literally</b>. The audience in John 6 actually recoils at this statement because it sounds like cannibalism, but Jesus later <b>clarifies</b> in John 6:63:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are <b>full of the Spirit and life</b>."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>In other words, he is talking about <b>spiritual sustenance</b>, not an endorsement of a sacrificial system.</p>

    <p class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-6">What about Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22?</p>

    <p>Many will point to Isaiah 53 and say, <i>"Look, this is Jesus!"</i> They read Psalm 22 and gasp, <i>"He quoted this on the cross—proof!"</i></p>

    <p>But here's the problem. <b>It's not. It never was.</b> These weren't future predictions. They weren't neon signs flashing "Messiah incoming!" They were <b>desperate attempts</b> to retro-fit Jesus into a mold he never fit. Let's start with Isaiah 53.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities..."</i> (Isaiah 53:5).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Sounds familiar? Sure. But let's <b>zoom out</b>. Who is Isaiah talking about? A singular Messiah in the distant future? No. He's describing the <b>Suffering Servant</b>—a symbolic figure who, throughout Isaiah, is clearly identified as <i>Israel itself</i>. The nation. The people. God's servant, suffering in exile, bearing the sins of its oppressors. Don't take my word for it. Take Isaiah's. Just two chapters earlier, he <b>spells it out</b>:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"You are my servant, <b>O Israel</b>, in whom I will display my splendor."</i> (Isaiah 49:3)</p>
    </div>

    <p><b>Not Jesus. Not a messianic savior. Israel.</b> If you've grown up in the church, like myself, it's almost impossible not to read Jesus into Isaiah 53? The blood-atonement message needed an Old Testament prophecy to legitimize Paul's gospel of blood atonement.</p>

    <p class="text-xl font-bold text-center my-6">And Psalm 22?</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</i> (Psalm 22:1).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Sounds like Jesus' cry on the cross. But let's take a breath. Psalm 22 <b>isn't a prophecy</b>. It's a poem. A lament. A raw, human cry of despair from a suffering king—<i>David, not Jesus</i>. And if we actually read past the cherry-picked verses, we see something critical:</p>

    <p>The suffering man <b>escapes death</b>. He is <b>rescued</b>. His cries are <b>heard</b>.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"For he has <b>not</b> despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has <b>not</b> hidden his face from him but has <b>listened</b> to his cry for help."</i> (Psalm 22:24)</p>
    </div>

    <p>This isn't about crucifixion. It's about <b>survival</b>. It's about God <i>saving</i> the afflicted, not sacrificing him.</p>

    <p>Yet Christians stop at the painful parts, circle the "pierced hands and feet" (a mistranslation, by the way – explained in Appendix 3), and say, <i>"See? Jesus!"</i></p>

    <p>It's a <b>hack job</b>. A desperate reach. A text taken out of context, force-fitted into a story that needs an Old Testament foundation. But the foundation <i>crumbles</i> under scrutiny. Isaiah wasn't prophesying a human blood sacrifice. David wasn't predicting a Roman execution. And Jesus? He <b>never once</b> pointed to these passages and said, <i>"That's me."</i></p>

    <p><b>Paul did. The gospel writers did. The church did.</b> But Jesus? He had his own words. His own mission. And it had <b>nothing</b> to do with fulfilling some twisted prophecy of slaughter.</p>

    <p>It's time to see Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 for what they really are: beautiful, poetic, and <b>utterly unrelated to Jesus</b>.</p>

    <p><i>"What about John 3:16"</i> you may counter: <i>"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son..."</i></p>

    <p>People read "gave" and assume it means <i>"gave to be slaughtered."</i> But that assumption is <b>reading Paul back into Jesus</b>. The context here speaks of giving Jesus to the world as a <b>revelation of God's love</b>, not explicitly as a blood atonement. In fact, the very next verse (John 3:17) <b>clarifies</b>:</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"For God did <b>not</b> send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to <b>save</b> the world through him."</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>That sounds more like a <b>living example of divine love</b> rather than a sacrificial payment. When Paul makes statements like <i>"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures"</i> (1 Corinthians 15), he is interpreting Jesus' death through his own theological lens, a lens shaped by Jewish sacrificial thinking and his own revelations. The phrase "according to the Scriptures" means Paul is <i>weaving Jesus' story into an Old Testament framework</i>, particularly Isaiah's suffering servant.</p>

    <p>Jesus himself <b>never preached</b> a gospel of <i>"I must die for your sins."</i> Jesus never said things like, <i>"Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins"</i> (Hebrews 9:22). This is the writer of Hebrews (not Jesus), using the logic of the Jewish sacrificial system to justify a theology of atonement. Yet, interestingly, Jesus himself, I don't mind repeating it yet again, quotes Hosea 6:6: <i>"I desire mercy, not sacrifice."</i> Jesus' consistent message was one of forgiveness granted <b>freely</b> by a merciful God, not contingent on ritual bloodletting.</p>

    <p>So what did Jesus actually say about his own death?</p>

    <p>He spoke of it as an <b>inevitable consequence</b> of his radical message, not as a divine transaction. He warned his followers that challenging the religious and political powers of the day would get him killed (Luke 13:34, Matthew 23:37). His focus was always on the <b>kingdom of God</b>, a movement of justice, love, and mercy—not a celestial payment plan.</p>

    <p>Paul's Jesus had to die as a blood sacrifice. <b>Jesus' Jesus had to live</b>, even if it cost him everything. And that is a <b>radical difference</b>. Jesus didn't die to satisfy God. He died because he <b>challenged power</b>. He was executed by men who feared his message of love and mercy. And as he died? ... <b>He forgave</b>.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"Father, <b>forgive them</b>, for they don't know what they are doing."</i> (Luke 23:34).</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>No transaction. No cosmic debt ledger. Just love that needed no blood to be valid.</i></p>

    <p>Paul took that moment and <b>dragged it back</b> into the old system of sacrifice. He dressed it up in temple language. He made it a legal contract. He <b>resurrected the very thing Jesus came to destroy</b>.</p>

    <p>If Paul was deceived, <b>everything changes</b>. His gospel. His theology. His obsession with blood. Because the Father Jesus preached? He <b>doesn't need sacrifices</b>. And the Jesus who actually lived? He wasn't a lamb on an altar.</p>

    <p>He was a man who <b>shattered altars</b>.</p>

    <p>A man who <b>forgave without payment</b>.</p>

    <p>A man who didn't blind his followers, but <b>opened their eyes</b>.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>So here's the question:</p>
        <p><b>Are we to follow Jesus? Or the voice that blinded Paul?</b></p>

    <p>By now, you've glimpsed the <b>cracks beginning to emerge</b> between Jesus and Paul. The Father of mercy and the god of sacrifices. <i>Two messages. Two paths.</i> Only one leads to freedom.</p>

    <p>Paul sold us a deal. A <i>contract in blood</i>. He told us that without slaughter, without death, without pain, we could never be free. <i>"Sin demands payment,"</i> he preached.</p>

    <p>And Jesus? According to Paul (and the subsequent gospel writers – Paul's letters were written long before the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke or John, as stated previously), Jesus was the <i>final installment</i>, the <i>last lamb on the altar</i>. The debt was settled.</p>

    <p>Sounds convincing. Feels safe. But there's a problem.</p>

    <p><b>Jesus never said any of this.</b></p>

    <p><i>Not once. Not in Galilee. Not in Jerusalem. Not on the cross.</i></p>

    <p>What Jesus did say was simple: <i>"I desire mercy, not sacrifice."</i> (Matthew 9:13). A Father who <b>forgives before you ask</b>. A kingdom where debts are <b>erased</b>, not collected. A world where grace flows <b>freely</b>, unbought and un-bargained. No blood required.</p>

    <p>Paul's gospel? It's a <b>different beast</b>. It isn't a story of a Father running to embrace his prodigal children. It's a <i>courtroom drama</i>. The kind where the judge won't dismiss your case until someone steps up to take your punishment. Justice must be served, Paul insists. And Jesus, poor Jesus, is led to the stand.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><i>"God presented Christ as a <b>sacrifice of atonement</b>, through the shedding of his blood"</i> (Romans 3:25). <i>"Christ, our <b>Passover lamb</b>, has been sacrificed"</i> (1 Corinthians 5:7).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Notice the pattern? Paul's Jesus is a <i>lamb</i>. A <i>blood payment</i>. A <i>corpse on the altar</i>.</p>

    <p>It's a brilliant theological <b>bait-and-switch</b>. Paul took the old system—the priests, the sacrifices, the endless river of blood spilled in Yahweh's name—and replaced the animals with Jesus. He tells us this is progress. A mercy, even. One sacrifice instead of many.</p>

    <p>But this isn't mercy. It's <b>refurbished brutality</b>.</p>

    <p>Jesus didn't come to be butchered for sin. He <b>forgave freely</b>. The paralytic lowered through a roof? Forgiven. The woman caught in adultery? Forgiven. The tax collectors and prostitutes who flocked to him? Forgiven. <i>No death. No blood. No contract. Just grace.</i></p>

    <p>Paul's gospel is different. In Paul's world, sin is a debt, and God is the ultimate debt collector. And the payment? <b>Blood. Always blood.</b> In Paul's world, Jesus took a bullet for you. But guess who was pulling the trigger? This evil atonement gospel has <b>maligned the character of our loving Father</b> beyond measure. What Paul did was resurrect the old, violent system Jesus had spent his life tearing down. He kept the machinery of sacrifice running, just changed the branding. And in doing so, he chained Christianity to the same barbaric logic that had ruled the Old Testament for centuries. The same logic that demanded Abraham bind Isaac to an altar. The same logic that led Yahweh to drown the world in a flood.</p>

    <p>If Jesus was the final sacrifice, Paul wasn't breaking the cycle. He was <b>completing it</b>.</p>

    <p>And the Father Jesus preached? The one who welcomes the prodigal home, who leaves the ninety-nine to find the lost one, who cancels debts instead of collecting them? Paul replaced Him with a <i>judge</i>. One who sits on high, ledger open, demanding a price before forgiveness can be given. <i>Forgiveness is free, but not cheap</i>, we are told in Sunday School.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>However, if Paul was wrong, if Jesus didn't die as a sacrifice but because evil people killed him, then the entire foundation of Western Christianity is built on a <b>lie</b>. A fatal one.</p>
        <p>A God who demands blood is <b>not</b> the God Jesus called Father.</p>
        <p>A faith built on contracts is <b>not</b> the gospel of grace.</p>
        <p>A sacrifice that replaces mercy is <b>not</b> salvation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let's examine what Paul taught through the lens of Jesus' teachings – the <b>real physical Jesus</b>, not the light-being who sends demons to torment.</p>
