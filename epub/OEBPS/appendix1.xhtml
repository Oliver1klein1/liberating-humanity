        7 Bible Contradictions from "101 Illustrated Bible Contradictions"
    </h2>

    <p>Here are 7 bible contradictions, in no particular order, taken from my book <strong><em>"101 Illustrated Bible Contradictions, And 12 Keys To Unlock The Truths These Reveal"</em></strong> for those who still cling to the idea that the bible contains <strong>text with no errors</strong>. Many folk don't realize that the current library of 66 books comprising most bibles was <em>not fully put together</em> when the verse <strong>"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"</strong> (2 Timothy 3:16) was written!</p>

        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 1: Beersheba</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">

    <p>In Genesis 21:31, it clearly says <strong>Abraham</strong> gave it that name after he made a covenant with Abimelek over a disputed well. But then in Genesis 26:33, it says <strong>Isaac</strong> gave the city the same name after his own encounter with Abimelek—again involving a well. So, <em>who did it first?</em> Did both name it independently? Did the name somehow get "re-named"? 
    
    While this may seem like a small detail, it taps into a bigger issue: <strong>biblical consistency</strong>, especially in stories meant to show how God worked through specific patriarchs. Theologically, it doesn't shake core doctrines, but it does raise questions about <em>historical accuracy</em> and editorial stitching in the text—especially if both accounts are meant to be historically literal. 
    
    Some scholars explain it away by saying Isaac merely reaffirmed the name that Abraham gave, or that the area was re-established after being lost or renamed by others. But <strong>the text itself doesn't say Isaac reaffirmed it</strong>—it presents it as a fresh naming moment. This makes the contradiction harder to dismiss as just a retelling.</p>

        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 2: King Jehoiachin's Age</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">

    <p>According to 2 Chronicles 36:9, he was <strong>8 years old</strong>. But in 2 Kings 24:8, it says he was <strong>18 years old</strong>. 
    
    That's a <em>huge</em> difference. <strong>Ten years is no small error</strong> when you're talking about whether a child or a young adult was ruling a kingdom. This contradiction has minor theological significance but raises real concerns for people who view Scripture as <strong>inerrant down to every word and number</strong>. 
    
    Critics argue that this discrepancy reveals how historical books may have been copied or edited over time with occasional numerical mistakes. Defenders of the Bible often try to <em>"explain it away"</em> by suggesting the Chronicler's version (8 years old) is a copyist's error—the Hebrew characters for 8 (שׁמֹנֶה) and 18 (שְׁמֹנֶה־עֶשְׂרֵה) are very similar and may have been misread by a scribe. Others argue that Jehoiachin may have been made co-regent at 8 and became full king at 18, although <strong>there's no strong textual support</strong> for that theory. 
    
    Either way, it paints a picture of <em>fragile bible texts</em> where seemingly simple details don't align.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Now that we've warmed up, let's get into some thornier contradictions:</strong></p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 3: Jesus' Lineage</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="c003-jesus-david-lineage.jpg" alt="Jesus lineage contradiction illustration" style="width: 60%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>This contradiction appears in the genealogies of Jesus found in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Amazingly, <strong>most churchgoers are unaware this one even exists!</strong> 
    
    Matthew 1:6 traces Jesus' lineage through <strong>Solomon</strong>, the royal son of David, which fits a narrative of kingship. But Luke 3:31 traces it instead through <strong>Nathan</strong>, another son of David who never ruled as king. <em>Both can't be biologically correct</em> if taken literally — so <strong>which is it?</strong> 
    
    Theologically, this matters because Messianic prophecy was thought to require descent from David, often interpreted to mean through the royal line. Some try to reconcile the two by saying Matthew gives Joseph's <em>LEGAL</em> line, while Luke gives Mary's biological line (with Heli as Mary's father and Joseph's father-in-law), <strong>despite the lack of evidence for this</strong>. Others propose the genealogies are symbolic, not historical. But there's <em>no indication</em> in either gospel that the genealogy is metaphorical — both present them as straightforward history. 
    
    So, unless one adopts a fancy workaround, this is a sticky one. Unfortunately, <strong>it gets worse</strong> in the next contradiction.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 4: Royal Disqualification</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="c004-royal-disqualification.jpg" alt="Royal disqualification contradiction illustration" style="width: 60%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>The issue of Jesus royal line deepens into another thorny issue: <strong>Can Jesus inherit David's throne if one of his ancestors was cursed by Yahweh to never have a descendant sit on it?</strong> 
    
    In Luke 1:32, the angel Gabriel declares that Jesus will be given <em>"the throne of his father David,"</em> fulfilling a major Messianic prophecy. But <strong>there's a snag</strong>. According to Matthew 1:11 and 1 Chronicles 3:16, Jesus is descended (through Joseph's line) from <strong>Jehoiakim</strong>, a king whom Yahweh curses in Jeremiah 36:30, saying that <em>none of his descendants will sit on David's throne</em>. 
    
    That seems to be a <strong>direct block</strong> to Jesus' claim — if he's biologically tied to Jehoiakim, the curse would disqualify him from the throne. Some apologists try to resolve this by saying Jesus wasn't Joseph's biological son (thus avoiding the curse – Mary was conceived by the Holy Sprit, remember?), or that Luke's genealogy represents Mary's line, which bypasses Jehoiakim entirely. But <strong>both solutions are speculative</strong> and not explicitly stated in the text. Also, <em>both lines pass through Joseph anyway</em>, so the legal argument remains thin at best. 
    
    If we take the genealogies and prophecies at face value, this becomes a <strong>genuine headache</strong> between prophetic promise and ancestral disqualification.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 5: Joseph's Father</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="c005-father-of-joseph.jpg" alt="Joseph's father contradiction illustration" style="width: 60%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>This previous contradiction flows into the next one, which was already implied (and even stated): <strong>Who was Joseph's father?</strong> According to Matthew 1:16, it was <strong>Jacob</strong>, but Luke 3:23 says it was <strong>Heli</strong>. 
    
    Obviously, <em>Joseph couldn't have had two biological fathers</em>, so something doesn't add up. This matters more than it first seems because these genealogies are often used to validate Jesus' Messianic credentials—tracing him legally or biologically back to King David. 
    
    To explain the discrepancy, some propose that Matthew traces the legal line (as stated in the previous contradiction perhaps via adoption or inheritance laws), while Luke gives the biological line, possibly through Mary (making Heli her father, and Joseph his son-in-law). But <strong>the text in Luke doesn't say anything about Mary</strong>—it clearly says Joseph was the son of Heli. Others suggest that one genealogy uses levirate marriage logic, where a man legally becomes the child of his mother's second husband if the first died without issue. 
    
    These workarounds exist—but <strong>they rely on speculation</strong> rather than what the texts clearly state. For readers who expect clean historical records, <em>this starts to get awkward</em>.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 6: Shelah's Father</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="c006-father-of-shelah.jpg" alt="Shelah's father contradiction illustration" style="width: 60%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>This one's easy to miss but highlights how even seemingly minor names can trigger big questions. In Genesis 10:24 and Genesis 11:12, <strong>Shelah is the son of Arphaxad</strong>. But in Luke 3:35–36, Luke inserts an extra generation: <strong>Shelah is the son of Cainan, who is the son of Arphaxad</strong>. 
    
    This causes a problem not only for biblical consistency but also for how genealogies were preserved and transmitted. <em>It's not just a typo</em> — the name <strong>Cainan appears nowhere</strong> in the Hebrew Old Testament manuscripts but does appear in some versions of the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament. Some argue Luke was simply quoting from that Greek source, while others say Cainan may have been added to Luke's genealogy by later copyists. 
    
    Theologically, this isn't earth-shattering - it doesn't affect doctrine - but it does <em>chip away</em> at the idea that genealogical records in the Bible are <strong>infallible or immune from scribal insertions</strong>.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <strong style="font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: navy;">Contradiction Number 7: Absalom</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="c007-absalom.jpg" alt="Absalom contradiction illustration" style="width: 60%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>This contradiction shows up in the genealogical listings of King David's sons. In 2 Samuel 3:3, Absalom is listed as David's <strong>third son</strong>, born to Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur. But over in 1 Chronicles 3:2, Absalom is listed as the <strong>fourth son</strong>, with the same mother. So <em>which is it</em> — third or fourth? 
    
    This isn't just a clerical detail; it matters because biblical genealogies were seen as signs of <strong>divine order, royal succession, and legitimacy</strong>. If Absalom was the third son, his eventual rebellion and claim to the throne carries different implications than if he was the fourth. 
    
    Those trying to smooth this over often argue that one of the earlier sons might have died young or been excluded for some reason, which shifted the ranking by the time Chronicles was compiled. Others suggest that the chronicler may have inserted an extra name, or that the writer of Samuel simply omitted someone. Either way, it reflects the <em>occasional messiness</em> in biblical record-keeping — especially when <strong>multiple sources were later merged</strong> to produce the canon we have today.</p>
