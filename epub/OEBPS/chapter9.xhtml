        Reclaiming Jesus from the Edits: The Father's Light Still Shines
    </h2>
    
    <div class="chapter-opening-quote">
        <p>"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all."</p>
        <span class="quote-author">— 1 John 1:5</span>
    </div>

    <p><span class="drop-cap">Y</span>ou've seen the brutality of Yahweh. You've seen Paul's theological hijack. You've watched the scribes twist the text until Jesus barely resembles himself. Now here's the question that won't go away:</p>

    <p>After everything religion has done to bury him under sacrifice, smoke, and male authority—<b>can we still find the real Jesus?</b></p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p><b>Yes. Because he's still here.</b></p>
        <p>Because the true Father—Jesus' Father—doesn't live in temples or doctrines or books. He lives in light. Blinding, undeniable, purifying light. Not one drop of darkness in Him. No violence. No vengeance. No hidden agendas. No shadowy corners. Just radiant love.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the Father Jesus came to reveal. And once you've seen Him, once the veil is torn, you can't go back. You won't be able to stomach sermons that glorify wrath. You won't be able to sing songs about blood and not gag. You'll start noticing the edits. The omissions. The insertions. The places where Jesus' words have been diluted or distorted or replaced altogether. And it will make you angry. It should.</p>

    <p>This is not about nitpicking theology. This is about the liberation of the human heart.</p>

    <p>Jesus didn't just teach love—he <b>EMBODIED</b> it. He didn't just talk forgiveness—he <b>LIVED</b> it. While being tortured, spat on, mocked, nailed to a piece of wood, he said, "Father, forgive them." No sacrifice. No payment. Just mercy. And if you still believe some divine justice system demanded blood before love could flow, you haven't met his Father.</p>

    <p>So how do we reclaim Jesus?</p>

    <p>First, we ditch the rulebook approach. We stop pretending that the Bible is a perfect text, unspoiled by agenda. I've probably irritated you with my repetition: The Bible itself says the scribes lied (Jeremiah 8:8). Jesus said the Pharisees made the word of God void with their traditions (Mark 7:13). Paul rewired the gospel into a Roman courtroom. Face it: the Bible is a battlefield of gods, and only one looks like Jesus.</p>

    <p>Second, we trust our gut—the part of us that cringes when told God drowned the world or sent bears to maul children. That voice that whispers, "This can't be right"—that's the light of the Father within you. Don't smother it. Follow it.</p>

    <p>Third, we let Jesus be the filter. Everything else—Moses, Isaiah, Paul, Revelation, all of it—gets held up to the light of Jesus' life and words. If it doesn't match, it gets tossed. This isn't spiritual rebellion. This is fidelity to the only one who ever showed us God's face.</p>

    <div class="bible-quote">
        <p>"Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father." (John 14:9)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Did Jesus ever call for war? Did he ever endorse execution? Did he ever shame, silence, or exclude? No. Not once.</p>

    <p>What he did was scandalous.</p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <ul>
            <li>He fed the wrong people.</li>
            <li>He touched the untouchables.</li>
            <li>He healed on the wrong day.</li>
            <li>He told women their voices mattered.</li>
            <li>He refused to retaliate.</li>
            <li>He exposed hypocrisy with laser precision.</li>
            <li>He walked into the temple and tore it apart because it had become a house of slaughter.</li>
            <li>He told people they were already forgiven before they even knew to ask.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>And the religious elite hated him for it. They still do.</p>

    <p>Because a Jesus who sets people free is a threat. Not just to power structures, but to the entire economy of guilt and penance religion is built on. And that's why they murdered him. Not to fulfill some ancient prophecy about divine wrath—but because <b>mercy is dangerous.</b> Mercy breaks the system.</p>

    <p>So let's say it clearly: <b>Jesus was not the sacrifice.</b> He was the one who exposed the entire sacrificial system as a lie. And they killed him for it. Then the scribes and theologians turned around and called that murder a necessary offering. They called it <b>salvation.</b> They called it <b>gospel.</b></p>

    <p>It wasn't.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>The real gospel is this:</p>
        <p><b>The Father has always been like Jesus.</b></p>
        <p><b>You were never separated.</b></p>
        <p><b>You were never unloved.</b></p>
        <p><b>You don't need to earn what has already been yours.</b></p>
        <p><b>You were born worthy.</b></p>
        <p><b>You don't need a middleman, a blood ritual, or a confession booth.</b></p>
        <p><b>You don't need theology to be loved.</b></p>
        <p><b>You don't need the church to access the Father.</b></p>
        <p><b>You just need to look at Jesus. And believe him.</b></p>
    </div>

    <p>Not believe <b>"IN" him</b>—as if he were some cosmic legal transaction—but believe <b>"HIM."</b></p>

    <div class="key-statement">
        <ul>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Love your enemies."</b></li>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Forgive seventy times seven."</b></li>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Blessed are the peacemakers."</b></li>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, not sacrifice."</b></li>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Love your partners, don't divorce them."</b></li>
            <li>When he said, <b>"Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us…"</b> John 17:21</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>That's your gospel.</p>

    <p>Think about what Jesus said about your relationship with himself and the Father. Ponder on John 17:21. This simple diagram may help.</p>

    <img src="Unity.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the unity between You, Jesus, and The Father" class="unity-diagram"/>

    <p>You don't need a <b>crucified God.</b> You need a <b>revealed one.</b></p>

    <p>And Jesus revealed Him. The forgiver. The healer. The blesser of enemies. The Father who runs to meet prodigals and throws a party—not after punishment, but before repentance.</p>

    <p>This is the revolution.</p>

    <p>Not a new religion, but <b>the dismantling of every false image of God that has ever held you hostage.</b> Not a new system, but the death of systems and mental strongholds. The death of fear. The death of transactional forgiveness. And in its place: <b>LIFE. ABUNDANT LIFE. RADIANT, FEARLESS, UNSTOPPABLE LIFE.</b></p>

    <p>Check out the next book in the "Rediscovering Jesus' Subverted Teachings and the Father's Love" series, namely <b>"Reality Unveiled: How Jesus Revealed You Are More Powerful Than You Ever Imagined"</b> to dig deeper into understanding what Jesus was trying to tell us about <b>who WE are and the POWER and POTENTIAL we already possess!</b> You'll see how Near-Death Experiences, Quantum Physics, the 'Law of Attraction or Law of Assumption,' and much more all CONFIRM what Jesus was trying to tell us!</p>

    <p>So yes, the text was edited. The gospel was rewritten. Jesus was betrayed—again and again—by those claiming to speak for him.</p>

    <div class="quote-callout">
        <p>But the light shines in the darkness.</p>
        <p>And the darkness has not overcome it.</p>
        <p>It never will.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let it burn. Let the sacrifices, the blood cults, the fear-based faiths go up in flames.</p>

    <p>What will be left is Jesus, and the Father, and Us - all of humanity. Liberated.</p>

    <p>And that, my friends, is more than enough.</p>
